Here is the link for docuemntation on AWS
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev//VirtualHosting.html
and the important tips on using the virtual hosting of buckets are below:

Although Richard posted correctly, I want to emphasize the peculiar behaviors of region-specific endpoints.
Assuming you have the following buckets in these regions:

eastbucket in region us-east-1
westbucket in region us-west-1

1. If your bucket is in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region, you CANNOT use the full region name when attempting to access the bucket. This is true of both the subdomain / virtual host URL, and the Path URL.

https://eastbucket.s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com (WRONG - site timeout)
https://s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/eastbucket (WRONG - site timeout)

https://eastbucket.s3.amazonaws.com (correct)
https://s3.amazon.com/eastbucket (correct)

2. If your bucket is in any other region (for example, us-west-1):

Path URL versions MUST include the full region name in the URL
https://s3.amazonaws.com/westbucket (WRONG - error XML document)
https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/westbucket (correct)

Subdomain / virtual host URL will automatically redirect to the full region name
https://westbucket.s3.amazonaws.com (correct) automatically redirects to
https://westbucket.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com (correct)

Note the differences side by side:

https://eastbucket.s3.amazonaws.com (correct)
https://westbucket.s3.amazonaws.com (redirects to full region)

https://s3.amazonaws.com/eastbucket (correct)
https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/westbucket (correct)

https://s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/eastbucket (WRONG)
https://s3.amazonaws.com/westbucket (WRONG)

And more information from another blogger is here below:
us-east-1 is a special region, and has 4 ways of referencing buckets in it.
Essentially, if the url has s3-us-east-1, it flat out fails.
However, s3.us-east-1 (notice the dot ".") works like a champ no matter which style (below) you use.

Here's what works and what doesn't, using the virtual-hosted style URL.
The type i've indented here (the 2nd one) doesn't seem to be documented though.

  https://eastbucket.s3.amazonaws.com (WORKS)  
  -- https://eastbucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (WORKS)  
  https://eastbucket.s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com (DOESN'T WORK)
..and here's what works/doesn't work using path-style URLs

  https://s3.amazonaws.com/eastbucket (WORKS)  
  https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/eastbucket (WORKS)  
  https://s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/eastbucket (DOESN'T WORK)
